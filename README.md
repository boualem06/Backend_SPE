Data Processing and Visualization Web Application
Overview
This project is a web application developed during my Data Science and Web Development Internship at the Bureau de Recherches et d’Investigations Marketing. The application allows users to perform multivariate data analysis, create interactive visualizations, and analyze text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Role: Stagiaire en Data Science et Développement Web
Duration: July 2023 – October 2023
Location: Algiers, Algeria
Project Description
The web application facilitates data processing and visualization, providing users with an intuitive interface to interact with data, analyze trends, and uncover insights. The frontend is built with Next.js, while the backend leverages Flask (Python) to handle data processing and NLP-based analysis on textual data.

Features
Data Processing and Visualization:
Offers tools for multivariate data processing and interactive visualizations.
Supports data exploration through customizable charts and visual aids.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Integrates NLP methods for analyzing textual data, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and keyword extraction.
Automates text processing to uncover patterns in qualitative data.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js – A React-based framework for building fast, SEO-friendly, and responsive web applications.
Backend: Flask (Python) – A lightweight Python web framework for creating RESTful API endpoints.
NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK – Libraries for advanced natural language processing and text analysis.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm for the frontend (Next.js)
Python 3 and Flask for the backend
Install required Python libraries (Flask, spaCy, NLTK, etc.)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copier le code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
Frontend (Next.js):

bash
Copier le code
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The Next.js server will start on http://localhost:3000.
Backend (Flask):

bash
Copier le code
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
The Flask API will start on http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the application’s frontend interface.
Upload datasets, select visualization options, and perform NLP analysis on textual data.
Processed results and visualizations are displayed interactively on the frontend.
Future Improvements
Enhanced NLP Capabilities: Extend NLP functionality with additional models (e.g., entity recognition, sentiment analysis enhancements).
Data Export Options: Enable export of processed data and visualizations in various formats.
Scalability: Consider containerizing the application with Docker for easier deployment and scalability.
