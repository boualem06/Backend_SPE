# Data Processing and Visualization Web Application
# Overview
This project is a web application developed during my Data Science and Web Development Internship at the Bureau de Recherches et d’Investigations Marketing. The application allows users to perform multivariate data analysis, create interactive visualizations, and analyze text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

# Project Description
The web application facilitates data processing and visualization, providing users with an intuitive interface to interact with data, analyze trends, and uncover insights. The frontend is built with Next.js, while the backend leverages Flask (Python) to handle data processing and NLP-based analysis on textual data.

# Features
- Data Processing and Visualization:
- Offers tools for multivariate data processing and interactive visualizations.
- Supports data exploration through customizable charts and visual aids.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Integrates NLP methods for analyzing textual data,  topic modeling, and keyword extraction.

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js – A React-based framework for building fast, SEO-friendly, and responsive web applications.
- Backend: Flask (Python) – A lightweight Python web framework for creating RESTful API endpoints.
- NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK – Libraries for advanced natural language processing and text analysis.

# Installation
